# Wordle Solver

I wanted to see if I can programmatically solve the daily
[wordle puzzle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).
The game involves guessing a 5 letter word in 6 tries and getting a little
bit of feedback after each guess.

This repo also contains a terminal based replica of wordle.
